**Tweet Text:** Top 6 Load Balancing Algorithms.

**Image 1 Description:** The image presents a comprehensive overview of load balancing algorithms, showcasing six distinct methods for distributing network traffic across multiple servers. The title "Load Balancing Algorithms" is prominently displayed at the top-left corner.

**Algorithm Overview**

*   **Round Robin**: Each incoming request is routed to the next available server in sequence.
    *   Request 1: Server A
    *   Request 2: Server B
    *   Request 3: Server C
    *   Request 4: Server A (back to the start)
*   **Sticky Round Robin**: Similar to round robin, but with an added layer of persistence, where a user's subsequent requests are directed to the same server.
    *   Request 1: Server A
    *   Request 2: Server B
    *   Request 3: Server C
    *   Request 4: Server A (back to the start)
*   **Weighted Round Robin**: Assigns weights to each server based on their capacity or performance.
    *   Server A: Weight = 0.8
    *   Server B: Weight = 0.1
    *   Server C: Weight = 0.1
    *   Request 1: Server A (highest weight)
    *   Request 2: Server B
    *   Request 3: Server C
*   **Least Connections**: Directs incoming requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
    *   Server A: 5 connections
    *   Server B: 0 connections
    *   Server C: 1 connection
    *   Request 1: Server B (fewest connections)
    *   Request 2: Server C
    *   Request 3: Server A
*   **IP/URL Hash**: Maps incoming requests to a specific server based on their IP address or URL.
    *   Request 1: IP Address = 192.168.1.100, mapped to Server A
    *   Request 2: IP Address = 192.168.1.101, mapped to Server B
    *   Request 3: IP Address = 192.168.1.102, mapped to Server C
*   **Least Time**: Directs incoming requests to the server with the shortest response time.
    *   Server A: Response Time = 100ms
    *   Server B: Response Time = 50ms
    *   Server C: Response Time = 200ms
    *   Request 1: Server B (shortest response time)
    *   Request 2: Server A
    *   Request 3: Server C

In summary, the image illustrates six load balancing algorithms, each with its unique approach to distributing network traffic across multiple servers. These algorithms cater to different use cases and requirements, allowing administrators to choose the most suitable method for their specific needs.
