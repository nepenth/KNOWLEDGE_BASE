**Tweet Text:** What does API gateway do?

**Image 1 Description:** The image is a flowchart that illustrates the process of how an API gateway handles incoming requests from clients. The chart starts with the client sending a request to the API gateway, which then processes it through various steps before returning a response.

* **Client**
	+ Sends a request to the API gateway
* **API Gateway**
	+ Receives the request and checks for authentication and authorization
	+ Validates the request using parameter validation
	+ Routes the request to the appropriate service or microservice
	+ Returns a response to the client

The flowchart also highlights some of the key features of an API gateway, including:

* **Authentication**: The API gateway checks if the client has the necessary credentials to access the requested resource.
* **Authorization**: The API gateway checks if the client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
* **Parameter Validation**: The API gateway validates the parameters passed in the request to ensure they are valid and consistent with the expected format.
* **Service Discovery**: The API gateway routes the request to the appropriate service or microservice based on the request URL or other criteria.
* **Circuit Breaker**: The API gateway detects when a downstream service is not responding and prevents further requests from being sent to it until it becomes available again.

Overall, the flowchart provides a clear overview of how an API gateway works and the various steps involved in processing incoming requests. It highlights the importance of authentication, authorization, parameter validation, service discovery, and circuit breaking in ensuring secure and reliable communication between clients and microservices.
