**Tweet Text:** What's an API?

**Image 1 Description:** The image is an infographic that explains what an API (Application Programming Interface) is and how it works. The main points are:

*   **What is an API?**
    *   An API is a mechanism to communicate and exchange data between two services or applications.
    *   It stands for Application Programming Interface.
*   **How does an API work?**
    *   A client sends a request to the server through the API.
    *   The server processes the request and returns a response back to the client through the API.
    *   This process is repeated continuously, allowing data to be exchanged between the two services or applications.
*   **Example of an API in action**
    *   A customer places an order at a restaurant.
    *   The waiter takes the order from the customer and sends it to the chef via the API.
    *   The chef prepares the food and sends it back to the waiter through the API.
    *   The waiter delivers the food to the customer.

In summary, an API is a way for different services or applications to communicate with each other and exchange data. It works by sending requests from one service to another and receiving responses back, allowing data to be exchanged continuously. An example of this in action is a restaurant where a customer places an order, the waiter sends it to the chef via the API, the chef prepares the food and sends it back to the waiter through the API, and the waiter delivers the food to the customer.
