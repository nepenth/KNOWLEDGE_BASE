**Tweet Text:** Authentication Mechanisms

**Image 1 Description:** The image presents a comprehensive overview of the top four most used authentication mechanisms, providing a detailed explanation of each mechanism's functionality and components.

* **SSH Keys**
	+ A secure protocol for establishing trusted connections between clients and servers.
	+ Utilizes public-key cryptography to authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access.
	+ Components:
		- Host key: uniquely identifies the server
		- User key: used for authentication
		- Authentication server: verifies user credentials
* **OAuth Tokens**
	+ An authorization framework that enables secure delegation of access tokens between clients and servers.
	+ Provides a standardized way to obtain access tokens, which can be used to authenticate users or make API calls on their behalf.
	+ Components:
		- Client ID: uniquely identifies the client application
		- Access token: grants permission to access protected resources
		- Token validation: ensures the integrity and authenticity of the access token
* **SSL Certificates**
	+ A cryptographic protocol that secures data transmitted between a web server and its clients.
	+ Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data in transit.
	+ Components:
		- Certificate authority (CA): issues digital certificates to verify identity
		- Public key infrastructure (PKI): manages the creation, distribution, and revocation of public keys
		- Secure socket layer (SSL) handshake: establishes a secure connection between the client and server
* **Credentials**
	+ A mechanism for verifying user identities through passwords or other authentication factors.
	+ Ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources.
	+ Components:
		- Username/password combination: used to authenticate users
		- Authentication protocol: verifies the username/password combination against a database of stored credentials
		- Session management: manages user sessions and handles logout functionality

In summary, the image provides an in-depth look at four widely used authentication mechanisms: SSH keys, OAuth tokens, SSL certificates, and credentials. Each mechanism has its own set of components that work together to provide secure authentication and authorization for users accessing protected resources. By understanding these mechanisms and their components, developers can design more secure systems and applications.
