**Tweet Text:** My Notes on the Famous Book 'Clean Code'. Enjoy!!

**Image 1 Description:** The infographic, titled "Notes From The Book Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship," presents a comprehensive guide to coding principles. The title is situated in the top-right corner, accompanied by the author's Twitter handle "@mayank ahujaa" below it.

**Main Points:**

* **Names**
	+ Meaningful names should reveal intent and be pronounceable
	+ Avoid disinformation and single-letter variables
	+ Consistent terminology across codebase
* **Functions**
	+ Small functions with a single responsibility
	+ Clearly convey function's purpose
	+ Minimal arguments to avoid complexity
	+ No side effects to maintain predictability
* **Comments**
	+ Explain why, not what
	+ Avoid obvious comments
	+ Use version control instead of commented-out code
* **Objects and Data Structures**
	+ Encapsulation: hide data and behavior through methods
	+ Data over primitives: use classes to represent concepts
	+ Tell, don't ask: objects responsible for their own state
	+ Law of Demeter: an object should only talk to its immediate friends (dependencies)
* **Error Handling**
	+ Make errors explicit and handle them gracefully
	+ Specific exceptions instead of generic ones
* **Systems**
	+ Separation of concerns: divide system into modules with clear responsibilities
	+ Testability: design systems with testability in mind from the beginning
* **Formatting**
	+ Consistency is key
	+ Use blank lines to separate logical sections
	+ Indentation and spacing for readability
* **Classes**
	+ Small and cohesive classes
	+ Single responsibility and related methods
	+ Organized for change: encapsulate implementation details
* **Unit Tests**
	+ F.I.R.S.T. principles: fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and timely
	+ Clean tests: readable and maintainable as production code

**Summary:**

The infographic provides a concise and informative guide to clean coding principles, covering topics such as naming conventions, function structure, commenting, object-oriented design, error handling, system design, formatting, class organization, and unit testing. By following these guidelines, developers can write more maintainable, efficient, and effective code.
